> Where Gift Cards Meet Blockchain Gaming

### High Barriers to Entry for New Gamers
GameFi has a relatively high entry barrier as players need to acquire expensive NFTs and prepare tokens required by the game and blockchain protocol.

### Why Kukupon?
Faucet and POAP both have limitations and are not suitable for GameFi onboarding. Faucet has limitations in terms of user whitelisting, targeted distribution, and tracking of promotion results, while POAP still requires gas fees and is limited to xDAI, which may not be universally applicable to all games.
Kukupon combines the advantages of Faucet and POAP with GameFi onboarding to support a guest mode and provide entry NFTs. It’s a more efficient and flexible solution that can reduce operational costs while providing better user experiences and more effective promotion tracking.

## Just like a gift card in real-world
Kukupon revolutionizes the gaming industry by combining the best of gift cards and blockchain technology. It provides a secure way for users to enter the world of GameFi with a voucher code that can be redeemed for in-game rewards or currency. Game developers can easily create promotions and engage with their players by offering discounts or free transactions. Kukupon makes it easy to track promotion results and target specific user groups, making it an effective tool for marketing and community-building initiatives.

## How does it works?
Kukupon utilizes several key technologies to provide a secure and seamless gaming experience. One such technology is ERC-4337, which is deployed on the Polygon network to create a Paymaster for voucher payments and a voucher wallet for players. These wallets are one-time use and can be used in guest mode, with gas fees deducted directly from the wallet. This allows for a streamlined and cost-effective onboarding process for new players.
Kukupon also uses Airstack to track player activity on the blockchain, which helps to verify player experience and identity. By utilizing the WorldCoin zero-knowledge proof verification system, Kukupon ensures that player identities are verified and prevents duplicate voucher redemptions.
Overall, Kukupon’s use of these technologies allows for a secure and flexible gaming experience that is accessible to players of all experience levels.

## Wallet-Less Solution Ensures the Highest Security Without Any Burden
Kukupon eliminates the need for private keys and wallets, allowing users to make transactions without the need for advanced funding or any memory burden associated with private key handling. Players can use different devices with the same voucher code to access the account and play the game. With this flexible, wallet-less approach, we can further expand our capabilities in the future, including transaction acceleration and zero-knowledge proof verification.

## We Enable Guest Mode in Web3 Gaming
Kukupon uses ERC-4337 deployed on Polygon to create a Paymaster for voucher payments and a wallet for players to redeem vouchers. The use of WorldCoin’s zero-knowledge verification ensures secure and unique voucher redemption. The voucher wallet is a one-time-use wallet with gas fees deducted from it, registered under Paymaster. 

Guest mode is available for new players to try out games without committing funds upfront. This feature helps attract new players and encourages them to continue playing.

## Kukupon Helps You Engage Gamers
Kukupon can be used to reward loyal players, provide in-game items, currency, or other rewards with gift cards. Coupons can provide discounts for purchases in the game, such as character skins or items. Voucher codes can be used to redeem rewards or participate in special item or event giveaways. Promotions can be used to attract new players, providing exclusive in-game items or currency, or offering special bonuses for registration or referral of friends.

## Use Cases
Kukupon can be used for social media promotion, influencer marketing, and community building. It offers a way to provide free transactions or special discounts to players. It can be used to reward loyal players or incentivize new players to join. It can facilitate community engagement and improve overall user experience.

## Conclusion
Kukupon simplifies the promotion process, eliminates the need for a wallet or private key, and lowers the barrier to entry for players. It provides a way to offer value to players and support “guest mode” for new players without requiring them to commit funds upfront. Kukupon’s unique combination of technology and gaming offers a powerful tool for developers to engage players and build communities. As the blockchain gaming industry continues to grow, Kukupon has the potential to become a leading platform for innovative marketing and community-building initiatives.
