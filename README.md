## How it's made
> Tell us about how you built this project; the nitty-gritty details. What technologies did you use? How are they pieced together? If you used any sponsor technologies, how did it benefit your project? Did you do anything particuarly hacky that's notable and worth mentioning?

Kukuponpon was built using a variety of technologies to ensure a seamless gaming experience. 

* Airstack was used to track players' on-chain activity, while ERC-4337 was utilized to establish a Paymaster for Voucher payments and a Voucher Wallet for delivering Gift Cards to players. 
* WorldID was also employed to verify identities and prevent duplicate redemptions. 

By combining these technologies, we have created a secure and efficient way for players to enjoy GameFi. 

Our unique technology handles private keys, accelerates transactions, and enables zero-knowledge verification.
